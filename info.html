            <p> Neurodiversity has recently been more understood than ever before, 
            so these big steps to erase the stigma around mental 
            health or disabilities are finally being taken. Sadly, 
            most K-12 programs don’t require psychology or similar classes – 
            so many people enter their adult lives without understanding those 
            different than them. This also leads many neurodivergent 
            individuals to be undiagnosed and untreated throughout primary 
            schooling; with many not understanding why they struggle so much 
            with basic executive functions.</p>

                        <h3>So, what is it like?</h3>
                        Living with a neurodivergent mind changes everyday 
                        life in almost every way – especially since our 
                        ‘typical’ lives were created around a neurotypical 
                        lifestyle.<br>
                        A lot of individuals with ADHD struggle with executive 
                        functions that can make it extremely difficult to
                        perform daily tasks. Alongside this, many neurodiverse people
                        have very spesific sensory responses and can get overstimulated
                        by unpleasant sensory experiences. Another example is in the different
                        ways we process information while learning, which can be made very
                        challenging when dealing with Dyslexia or Audio Processing Disorder.<br>
                        Accomodations are extremely important to neurodiverse individuals,
                        and more are becoming readily availible to this day!
