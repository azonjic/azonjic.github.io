                <p><strong>Neurodiversity</strong> is a concept that emphasizes the natural variation in the human 
                    brain and recognizes that neurological differences - such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, 
                    and others - are simply part of the diversity of the human population. It suggests 
                    that these variations should be accepted and valued, rather than pathologized or stigmatized. 
                    The neurodiversity movement promotes the idea that individuals with neurological 
                    differences have unique strengths and perspectives that can contribute positively to society.
                    It advocates for inclusivity, accommodation, and understanding, challenging traditional notions 
                    of normalcy and promoting a more accepting and supportive approach to neurodivergent individuals.</p>
